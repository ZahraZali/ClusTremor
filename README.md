# ClusTremor
ClusTremor is an algorithm specifically designed for unsupervised clustering of seismic data, with a focus on tremor signals. Leveraging the power of deep learning and clustering techniques, we employ a deep clustering approach to effectively cluster volcanic tremors.

Our methodology utilizes an autoencoder, allowing the model to learn meaningful feature representations while assigning clusters to them. This joint learning process ensures the extraction of informative representations that capture the underlying patterns in tremor signals and effectively cluster them.

To showcase the practical application of the ClusTremor algorithm, we provide an example of its effectiveness in clustering volcanic tremors during the 2021 Geldingadalir eruption in Iceland. This demonstration serves to highlight the algorithm's capability in capturing meaningful clusters in real-world scenarios.

With ClusTremor, researchers and seismologists can leverage its unsupervised clustering capabilities to gain insights into the behavior and patterns of tremors, enabling a deeper understanding of seismic activity.
